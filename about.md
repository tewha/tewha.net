My name is a Steven Fisher, and I'm a programmer at [Discovery Software][discovery]. For almost 20 years I've been writing software, primarily for K12.

I've released and maintained software for a variety of operating systems including MS-DOS, Mac OS, Windows, Mac OS X and iOS. I am fluent in Pascal, SQL, C, C++, Objective-C and a smattering of smaller languages. I am interested in learning JavaScript and Ruby.

I'm married with a five year old son.

Other places I'm found online:
