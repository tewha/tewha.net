My name is a Steven Fisher, and I'm a programmer at Discovery Software. For almost 20 years I've been writing software, primarily for K12.

I've developed for a variety of operating systems including MSDOS, Windows, Mac OS X and iOS. I am fluent in Pascal, SQL, C, C++, Objective-C and a smattering of smaller languages. I am interested in learning JavaScript and Ruby.

I'm married with a five year old son.
