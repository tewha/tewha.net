title: "How not to do a 30 day trial"
---
Well, I downloaded the trial of [e][1], a poorly named but apparently quite capable text editor for Windows</a>. It was a 1.0 release and not very stable, so I uninstalled it on the first day I had it and waited for an update. I downloaded the update yesterday to discover...

The trial has 2 days remaining.

That's really all I needed to see. I immediately uninstalled it. e might very well be great software, but since I never really got to try it the developer is not going to get a purchase from me.

Anyone doing a time limited trial needs to seriously consider how it expires. This kind of 30 day trial doesn't give me a chance to evaluate the software, and it doesn't give the developer any chance to make a sale. The developer would be much better off using 30 days of use (like [Omni Group][2] products), or reseting the trial when the software is reinstalled, or even just resetting the trial for new releases. How many months in a row do you think someone's going to do an unnecessary uninstall/reinstall just to avoid paying a reasonable $34.95?

Anyway, that's all the feedback I have from a 30 day trial. Sad, isn't it?
