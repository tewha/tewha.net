Background information: [Daring Fireball linked][1] to my previous article about [the missing ↩ glyph][2] in the iPhone and iPod touch. Thankfully, [mx][3] gave me a heads up ((Actually, it was [Allen][4], but his email had a brief stay in purgatory.)), and I switched a few settings on my site to better deal with the extra attention. ((It looks like the particular Dreamhost server I'm on is being slammed, and from the load, it definitely isn't just this that's doing it. Although I can't imagine I'm helping much.))

Watching the log, though, I find one thing interesting:

	[19/Oct/2007:12:12:37 -0700] "GET /wp-content/themes/pyilewptheme/iphone.css HTTP/1.1" 200 355 "http://pyile.com/2007/10/i-want-my-%e2%86%a9/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/419.3 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/419.3"

	[19/Oct/2007:12:12:37 -0700] "GET /wp-content/themes/pyilewptheme/iphone.css HTTP/1.1" 200 354 "http://pyile.com/2007/10/i-want-my-%E2%86%A9/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.5) Gecko/20070718 Firefox/2.0.0.5"

It looks like Safari and Firefox encode the ↩ differently in URLs. I'm not sure which, if either, is "wrong ((I'm sure it's in the HTTP spec, but I can't be bothered looking it up right now.))," but I found this interesting. When I was testing the ↩ in the URL, I only checked that it **worked** in Firefox and Safari. I didn't think to check that they requested it the same way. I imagine Apache is doing the conversion here, but would other web servers do it as well?
