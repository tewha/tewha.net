I used the default packages and install options because I haven't seen my Office 2004 disc around in a while. The install was slow (I let it check the DVD), but required no intervention.

I thought Leopard's menu bar was supposed to be ugly! I guess they've toned it down, because this looks pretty good to me. I'm not sold on the dock, but that's okay: I know it can be [turned off][1].

Actually, if I had to describe it in three words, I'd say "System 7 modernized." That's a good thing. I thought Mac OS 8 was quite a step backwards, and Mac OS X has taken small but repeated steps back to the classic Mac look. Tiger is clean, with light backgrounds to its windows and a smooth gradient effect. Sheets are gorgeous.

My biggest complaint is that the window gradient is a little severe, especially on windows without toolbars. The dark end of the gradient is a little too dark.

Other random thoughts:

* Spotlight is reindexing. I'm not surprised.
* System Preferences and Safari are really responsive. More so with Spotlight indexing in the background than they were in Tiger.
* Quick Look is awesome. It would be nice if applications could launch this fast.
* QuickVerse doesn't work, but I'm pretty sure this isn't a last minute Leopard change.

I'll post more thoughts after I have some time to really explore this.
