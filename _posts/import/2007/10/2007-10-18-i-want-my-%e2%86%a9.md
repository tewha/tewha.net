Curiously, the iPhone and iPod touch are [missing the ↩][1] glyph ((If you see a box it's still missing)). I'm sure it's missing because Apple never thought anyone would use it, but it's being used as a footnote return character by [John Gruber][2], [Allen Pike][3] and [mx][4], among thousands ((ten thousands?)) more.

Apple does respond to feedback, so it's worth asking. If you've got an iPod touch, file feedback <a href="http://www.apple.com/feedback/ipodtouch.html">here</a>. If you've got an iPhone, the feedback site is <a href="http://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html">here</a>.
