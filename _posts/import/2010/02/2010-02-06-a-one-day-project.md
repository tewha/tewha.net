I started work today on an iPhone project with a friend. I figured it would take only a day to get to a reasonable 1.0. I've only put in about a half day on it so far, but at this point I'm pretty sure it's actually a two day project.

Looked at one way, that's a 200% estimation overflow. But more realistically, it means it was pretty small and I tackled it in the wrong way. I had to refactor some code early that I left alone for too long. I should've written in the right way to begin with, and I should have realized it was wrong sooner, and I should have stopped trying to make it work.



More pragmatically, maybe I should have known better. But, of course, I didn't. And that's okay! I know better now.



What's my point in posting this?



Mostly, it's this: <strong>iPhone development isn't nearly as hard as I've made it out to be</strong>. Useful applications can actually be quite small and still be useful. Simple things are simple. When they're not simple, it's time to fix something.



I'll post a link here when I finish the project. It'll be a bit before I can devote another day to it. But I'm excited by its usefulness, its simplicity, and the idea of having an app in the App Store of my own.
