title: "Flux adjusts your monitor's color temperature"

Install [Flux][1] right now.

What does it do? Well, at sunset it adjusts the color temperature of your monitor to make it warmer and less glaring. At sunrise, it adjusts it back.

I installed it yesterday afternoon; yesterday and today at sunset, it automatically adjusted my monitor's color temperature. The difference on the eyes is nothing short of amazing. And if you need to do some accurate color work, it has a menu that lets you turn it off for an hour.
